# Semantic Workbench: Building custom Assistant with LangGraph framework

[Semantic Workbench](https://github.com/microsoft/semanticworkbench) is an open-source platform developed by Microsoft, designed to simplify the prototyping and development of intelligent assistants. It consists of a _backend service_, a _frontend user interface_ (UI) and multiple _assistant services_. The platform is highly adaptable and can support wide range of use cases from research to business applications and collaborative development.

My GitHub repo provides a step-by-step guide on building and deploying a LangGraph-based assistant within the Semantic Workbench environment. It includes code examples and explanations of some key concepts. This assistant example demonstrates a specific use case: searching for and analysing arXiv publications to support the research process.

> Note: These instructions assume that you have cloned and are using the source code of Semantic Workbench from its official repo: https://github.com/microsoft/semanticworkbench.
